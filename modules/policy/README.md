## ORM mapping:
* tblPolicy > Policy
* tblPolicyRenewal > PolicyRenewal

## Listened Django Signals
* `signal_mutation_module_validate["policy"]`: handles PolicyMutations (create, update, renew, suspend and delete)

## Services
* ByFamilyService - retrieves policies of a family
* ByInsureeService - retrieves policies of an insuree
* FilteredPoliciesService - generic policy fetch service (used by ByFamilyService and ByInsureeService services)
* EligibilityService - can be disabled in config and exposes signals

## Reports (template can be overloaded via report.ReportDefinition)
None

## GraphQL Queries
* policy_values: gql to compute policy values (start/end date and value), based on family (composition), enrollment date and product
* policies: gql binding to PolicyGQLType
* policies_by_family: gql binding to ByFamilyService
* policies_by_insuree: gql binding to ByInsureeService
* policy_eligibility_by_insuree: gql binding to EligibilityService, with insuree criteria
* policy_item_eligibility_by_insuree: gql binding to EligibilityService, with insuree and item  criteria
* policy_service_eligibility_by_insuree: gql binding to EligibilityService, with insuree and service criteria
* policy_officers: gql binding to OfficerGQLType

## GraphQL Mutations - each mutation emits default signals and return standard error lists (cfr. openimis-be-core_py)
* create_policy
* update_policy
* delete_policies
* renew_policy
* suspend_policies

## Configuration options (can be changed via core.ModuleConfiguration)
* gql_query_policies_perms: required rights to query policies (default `['101201']`)
* gql_query_policy_officers_perms": required rights to query policy officers (`[]` i.e. none, as in 'open to everybody'),
* gql_query_policies_by_family_perms: required rights to call policies_by_family gql (default `['101201']`)
* gql_query_policies_by_insuree_perms: required rights to call policies_by_insuree gql (default `['101201']`)
* gql_mutation_create_policies_perms": required rights to perform 'create' mutation (default `['101202']`),
* gql_mutation_renew_policies_perms": required rights to perform 'renew' mutation (default `['101205']`),
* gql_mutation_edit_policies_perms": required rights to perform 'update' mutation (default `['101203']`),
* gql_mutation_suspend_policies_perms": required rights to perform 'suspend' mutation (default `['101203']`),
* gql_mutation_delete_policies_perms": required rights to perform 'delete' mutation (default `['101204']`),
* gql_query_eligibilities_perms: required rights to call policy_eligibility_by_insuree, policy_item_eligibility_by_insureegql, policy_service_eligibility_by_insuree (default `['101201']`)
* default_eligibility_disabled: disable the stock eligibility service and rely only on signals (default: `False`)
* policy_renewal_interval: Notify renewal nb of days before expiry date, default: `14`
* policy_location_via: Filter policies on user's location path. Default: via `family` location (otherwize via product)

## openIMIS Modules Dependencies
* claim.models.ClaimOfficer
* insuree.models.Family
* product.models.Product

## strategy context

### member list

Contribution plan strategy can propose the member list by providing an execution context "members", it must return a list of insuree (queryset not yet supported)

### policy value

Contribution plan strategy can propose policy value by providing an execution context "value", it must return a decimal

### validity


Contribution plan strategy can propose policy value by providing an execution context "validity", it must return a dict with 
- 'enroll_date'
- 'start_date'
- 'effective_date'
- 'expiry_date'
